## Introduction

Transformer models have revolutionized the field of natural language processing (NLP) with their ability to capture long-range dependencies in data. This project introduces an innovative approach by integrating an evolutionary algorithm with a transformer model, allowing the model to simulate reproduction and evolution. The evolutionary algorithm includes mechanisms for selection, crossover (simulating sexual reproduction), and mutation, fostering diversity and potentially leading to more robust models.

Key components of the model include:

- **Multi-Query Attention (MQA)**: An efficient attention mechanism that reduces memory usage and computational complexity.
- **Mixture of Experts (MoE)**: A method to increase model capacity without a proportional increase in computational cost, using multiple expert networks and a gating mechanism.

## Model Architecture

### Multi-Query Attention

#### Explanation

Multi-Query Attention (MQA) is an optimization of the standard multi-head attention mechanism used in transformers. In traditional multi-head attention, each head has its own set of queries, keys, and values. MQA simplifies this by sharing keys and values across all attention heads while maintaining separate queries. This reduces the memory footprint and computational requirements, especially beneficial for models handling long sequences.

#### Advantages

- **Memory Efficiency**: Sharing keys and values reduces the number of parameters and the amount of memory needed.
- **Computational Speed**: Fewer computations are required for keys and values, leading to faster processing.
- **Scalability**: Allows the model to handle longer sequences more effectively.

#### Implementation Details

In the provided code, the `MultiQueryAttention` class implements MQA:

```python
class MultiQueryAttention(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, embed_dim: int, num_heads: int):
        # Initialization code
    def forward(self, x: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
        # Forward pass code
```

- **Queries (`q`)**: Computed separately for each head.
- **Keys (`k`) and Values (`v`)**: Shared across all heads.

### Mixture of Experts

#### Explanation

The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture enhances model capacity by utilizing multiple expert networks. A gating mechanism decides how to combine the outputs of these experts for each input token, allowing the model to specialize and generalize better.

#### Gating Mechanism

- **Input-Dependent Routing**: The gate computes weights for each expert based on the input.
- **Expert Networks**: Each expert is a feed-forward network that processes the input.
- **Output Combination**: The outputs of the experts are combined using the gate's weights.

#### Implementation Details

In the `MixtureOfExperts` class:

```python
class MixtureOfExperts(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, embed_dim: int, expert_dim: int, num_experts: int):
        # Initialization code
    def forward(self, x: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
        # Forward pass code
```

- **Experts**: A list of feed-forward networks.
- **Gate**: A linear layer that outputs weights for each expert.

### Transformer Encoder Layer

#### Combining MQA and MoE

Each encoder layer integrates both MQA and MoE:

```python
class TransformerEncoderLayer(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, embed_dim: int, num_heads: int, expert_dim: int, num_experts: int):
        # Initialization code
    def forward(self, src: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
        # Forward pass code
```

- **Self-Attention**: Uses `MultiQueryAttention`.
- **Feed-Forward Network**: Replaced with `MixtureOfExperts`.
- **Layer Normalization**: Applied after each sub-layer.

### Evolutionary Algorithm

The evolutionary algorithm simulates reproduction and evolution in the model population.

#### Components

- **Population**: A set of transformer models.
- **Selection**: Choosing the best-performing models based on evaluation scores.
- **Crossover**: Combining parameters from two parent models to create offspring.
- **Mutation**: Introducing random changes to offspring to maintain diversity.

#### Process

1. **Evaluation**: Each model is evaluated on a dataset, and scores are assigned.
2. **Selection**: Top-performing models are selected as parents.
3. **Crossover**: Parents are paired, and their parameters are combined to produce children.
4. **Mutation**: Random mutations are applied to the children's parameters.
5. **Next Generation**: The new population replaces the old one, and the process repeats.

## Algorithms

### Multi-Query Attention Mechanism

**Algorithm Steps:**

1. **Compute Queries (`Q`)**: Linear transformation of input `X`.
2. **Compute Shared Keys (`K`) and Values (`V`)**: Single linear transformation for keys and values.
3. **Split Queries into Heads**: Reshape `Q` to separate heads.
4. **Calculate Attention Scores**: Compute scaled dot-product of `Q` and `K`.
5. **Apply Softmax**: Normalize attention scores to obtain weights.
6. **Compute Attention Output**: Multiply weights by `V`.
7. **Concatenate Heads**: Merge the heads back into a single tensor.
8. **Final Linear Transformation**: Apply output projection.

### Mixture of Experts Forward Pass

**Algorithm Steps:**

1. **Compute Gate Scores**: Apply softmax to the output of the gate network.
2. **Process Input Through Experts**: Pass input `X` through each expert network.
3. **Stack Expert Outputs**: Combine outputs into a single tensor.
4. **Combine Using Gate Scores**: Multiply expert outputs by gate scores and sum them.

### Evolutionary Algorithm Steps

1. **Initialize Population**: Create a population of random models.
2. **Evaluate Population**: Calculate a fitness score for each model.
3. **Selection**: Choose the top-performing models as parents.
4. **Crossover**: For each pair of parents:
   - Create a child model.
   - For each parameter:
     - Randomly select the parameter from one of the parents.
5. **Mutation**: For each child model:
   - For each parameter:
     - With a certain probability, add a small random value.
6. **Next Generation**: Replace the old population with the new one.
7. **Repeat**: Continue for a specified number of generations.
