# Zeta Docs

Welcome to Zeta's Documentation!

Zeta is a modular framework that enables for seamless, reliable, and fluid creation of zetascale AI models.

Zeta is transforming the landscape of AI from siloed AI agents to a unified 'swarm' of intelligence. Through relentless iteration and the power of collective insight from our 1500+ Agora researchers, we're developing a groundbreaking framework for AI collaboration. Our mission is to catalyze a paradigm shift, advancing Humanity with the power of unified autonomous AI agent swarms.


This documentation covers the fundamentals of the **Zeta** framework and describes how to use **Zeta Tools**.

## Zeta

The Zeta framework provides developers with the ability to create AI systems that operate across two dimensions: predictability and creativity. For predictability, Zeta enforces structures like sequential pipelines, DAG-based workflows, and long-term memory. To facilitate creativity, Zeta safely prompts LLMs with [tools](https://github.com/kyegomez/swarms-tools) and short-term memory connecting them to external APIs and data stores. The framework allows developers to transition between those two dimensions effortlessly based on their use case.

Zeta not only helps developers harness the potential of LLMs but also enforces trust boundaries, schema validation, and tool activity-level permissions. By doing so, Zeta maximizes LLMs’ reasoning while adhering to strict policies regarding their capabilities.
