# interpolate_pos_encoding_2d

# Module Name: interpolate_pos_encoding_2d

## Introduction:

This utility function named `interpolate_pos_encoding_2d` handles the 
interpolation of position embeddings for sequences and is commonly used 
in the Deep learning models dealing with sequential data like Recurrent Neural 
Networks (RNNs) and variants, Transformers etc.

Positional embeddings help these models to distinguish the order of presented 
values, this becomes especially relevant when dealing with transformer models 
as transformers lack recurrent or convolutional structure to handle this 
information natively.

If the target spatial size and the original spatial size are equal, the 
original positional embeddings are returned directly. However, if the sizes differ, 
this function uses the bicubic interpolation method provided by PyTorch's 
`nn.functional.interpolate()` to adjust the size of the positional embeddings as per 
the target spatial size. 

To ensure computational efficiency along with numerical precision, this function 
also includes an option to convert the original data type of the positional 
embeddings to float32 during the interpolation process (if originally in 
bfloat16). After the interpolation process, the data is converted back to bfloat16.


## Function Definition:

`interpolate_pos_encoding_2d(target_spatial_size, pos_embed)`

```
Performs interpolation on 2D positional embeddings as per the given target spatial size.

Parameters:
- target_spatial_size (int): Target spatial size for the embeddings.
- pos_embed (Tensor): Initial 2D positional embeddings.

Returns:
- pos_embed (Tensor): 2D positional embeddings after necessary interpolations and type conversions.
```

## Functionality and Usage:

### Functionality:

Here is the step-wise functionality of the `interpolate_pos_encoding_2d` function:

1. Fetches the initial spatial size of the positional embeddings.
2. If the initial and target spatial sizes are the same, it returns the original positional embeddings directly.
3. If the sizes differ, it proceeds with the interpolation.
4. Interpolation process:
    1. First, it checks if the initial positional embeddings are in `bfloat16` format. If so, converts them to `float32`. This is achieved by calling the function `cast_if_src_dtype`.
    2. Reshapes the positional embeddings and applies the bicubic interpolation by using `nn.functional.interpolate()` method to adjust the size.
    3. If the original data type was `bfloat16`,
