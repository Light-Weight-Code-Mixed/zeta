# group_by_key_prefix

# Function Name: group_by_key_prefix

The function group_by_key_prefix splits a dictionary into two based on whether the keys in the original dictionary start with a specified prefix. This allows us to organize the input dictionary by separating entries that are categorized by their key prefix. 

## Function Definition and Parameters 

The function group_by_key_prefix is defined as follows: 

```python
def group_by_key_prefix(prefix, d):
    """
    Group dictionary items by keys that start with a specific prefix.

    Args:
        prefix (str): The prefix to check for.
        d (dict): The dictionary to group.

    Returns:
        tuple: Two dictionaries split based on the prefix condition.
    """
    return group_dict_by_key(partial(string_begins_with, prefix), d)
```

Here, the function takes two parameters. They are:

1. prefix -
   Type: str
   Description: It is the prefix string that the function uses to check if the keys in the dictionary start with this piece of string.

2. d -
   Type: dict
   Description: This is the dictionary that the function is required to perform the operation on. The function traverses the keys of this dictionary and groups them into two dictionaries based on whether or not they start with the specified prefix.

## Usage Examples

Now, let's run through some examples of how to use this function and what kind of output we can expect in different scenarios:

### Example 1: Handling general case

First, let's look at how the function handles a general case.

```python
# First, we define a dictionary to be used for this example
example_dict = {"pear" : 1, "apple" : 2, "banana" : 3, "peach" : 4, "peanut" : 5}

# Now, let's use the function to split this dictionary based on the prefix "pea"
split_dict = group_by_key_prefix("pea", example_dict)

# This will output two dictionaries:
# The first containing all those entries whose keys start with "pea", and the second containing the rest.
```

### Example 2: Handling an empty input dictionary

Next, let's examine how the function handles an empty input dictionary.

```python
# In this case, we use an empty dictionary as our input
empty_dict = {}

# Then we split this empty dictionary based on any prefix, say "test"
split_dict
