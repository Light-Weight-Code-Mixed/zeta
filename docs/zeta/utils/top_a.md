# top_a

# zeta.utils.top_a() function Documentation

`top_a` is a PyTorch function that adjusts the logits based on a specific threshold determined by a ratio and a power of the maximum probability. 

This function performs an operation known as top-k sampling or nucleus sampling in Natural Language Processing (NLP). It discards a portion of tokens with the lowest probabilities of being the next token prediction in language models, based on a certain limit. 

In general, this function is used in certain applications of probabilistic models where you want to restrict the possibilities to a set of most probable outcomes. This function does this by creating a limit and then setting probabilities that fall under this limit to an effectively infinitesimal value.

The logic behind this method is to make some of the outcomes impossible (those that fall under the limit) and others equally likely (those above the limit). The effect is to make the randomly selected index more likely to be one of the most probable indices.

This function fits with the main purpose of PyTorch, which is to ease deep learning implementations, by providing an extra level of flexibility on the level of randomness included in models.

## Function Definition

```python
def top_a(logits, min_p_pow=2.0, min_p_ratio=0.02):
```
The function uses two parameters, `min_p_pow` and `min_p_ratio` that are used to compute the limit of probabilities.

| Parameter  | Type    | Default Value | Description                                                               |
|------------|---------|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `logits`     | Tensor  | None          | Model predictions in logits                                               |
| `min_p_pow`  | Float   | 2.0           | A value to control the the power of the maximum probability in the limit |
| `min_p_ratio`| Float   | 0.02          | A coefficient to control the ratio of the limit                           |

## Usage

First, you need to install PyTorch. This can be done using pip.

```bash
pip install torch
```

Next, use the function inside your code. Import PyTorch and zeta utils first.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn.functional as F
from zeta.utils import top_a 

logits = torch.randn(5, num_classes) # substitute num_classes with the number of classes in your model
modified_logits = top_a(logits)
```

In above example, original `
