# maybe

# Module Name: maybe

## Overview:

The `maybe` function is a Python decorator, that wraps a function and calls it only if the first argument to the function exists. This can help in implementing conditional function calls based on the existence of the first input argument. It is intended to improve code organization and readability, and it can be particularly useful when dealing with functions that require the existence of an input argument for successful execution.

## Module Interface:

The module provides a function wrapper `maybe` that accepts one input parameter, the function to be wrapped. The wrapped function `inner(x, *args, **kwargs)` has the ability to take any positional and keyword arguments.

Hereafter is a detailed table demonstrating `maybe` module interface.

| Function Name | Argument | Description                                                                                       | Type | Default |
|---------------|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------|---------|
| maybe         | fn       | This argument refers to the function that needs to be wrapped. This function should be callable. | Any  | None    |

## Example Usage:

In this section, we will provide several examples to demonstrate how you can use the `maybe` function.

### Example 1 - Basic Usage:

```python
from functools import wraps

def exists(x):
    return x is not None

def maybe(fn):
    @wraps(fn)
    def inner(x, *args, **kwargs):
        if not exists(x):
            return x
        return fn(x, *args, **kwargs)
    return inner

@maybe
def add_one(x):
    return x + 1

print(add_one(4))  # Output: 5
print(add_one(None))  # Output: None
```

In this snippet, we define a decorator `maybe` which wraps the function `add_one`. When the input to `add_one` is None, no operation is done and None is returned.

### Example 2 - Varied Input:

```python
@maybe
def add(x, y):
    return x + y

print(add(4, 5))  # Output: 9
print(add(None, 5))  # Output: None
```

In this example, we wrap a function `add` which takes two arguments. When the first argument is None, `maybe` prevents `add` from being executed and returns `None` instead. 

### Example 3 - Complex Functions:

```python
@maybe
def complex_func(x
