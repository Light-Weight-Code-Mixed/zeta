## 1. How is Zeta different from LangChain?

Zeta is an open source alternative to LangChain and differs in its approach to creating LLM pipelines and DAGs. In addition to agents, it uses more general-purpose DAGs and pipelines. A close proxy might be *Airflow for LLMs*. Zeta still implements chain of thought logic for prompt tasks that use "tools" but it also supports any type of input / output (images, audio, etc.).
